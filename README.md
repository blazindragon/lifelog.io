What were you doing two years ago on Thursday? Most people couldn't tell you
either. Lifelog is a micro-journaling application to help you track your life,
accomplishments, and progress through the various tasks that make up your day.
It can help you answer questions like the one above.

The source code housed in this repository powers the backend of the application
running on [lifelog.io][1]. If you wish to start micro-journaling with lifelog,
you can [sign up][2] on lifelog.io and use the software for free.
