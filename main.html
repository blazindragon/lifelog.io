    <p>What were you doing two years ago on Thursday? Most people couldn't tell you

    accomplishments, and progress through the various tasks that make up your day.
    It can help you answer questions like the one above.</p>

    <p>You can get started micro-journaling with lifelog by
    <a href='#/signup'>creating an accont</a>.</p>
