    </div>

    <p>What were you doing two years ago on Thursday? Most people couldn't tell you
    either. Lifelog is a micro-journaling application to help you track your life,
    accomplishments, and progress through the various tasks that make up your day.
    It can help you answer questions like the one above.</p>

    <p>You can get a preview of what it's like to lifelog using the
    demonstration interface below. Keep in mind that changes won't be saved
    until you sign in to your own account. You can get started micro-journaling
    with lifelog by <a href='#/signup'>signing up</a>.</p>
