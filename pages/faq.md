### What Is Lifelog?
Lifelog is a micro-journaling platform that allows you to record snippets of
your life through text, photo, and video. Think of it like a tiny version of a
journal, diary, or log someone might keep in their bedroom drawer.

### Why Have You Made All Source Code Freely Available?
Making the lifelog platform open source was a natural choice for many reasons.

First and foremost, the lifelog platform is itself built upon open source
software. It wouldn't have been possible without the high quality source code
from authors around the globe who spend millions of man-years perfecting each
line and each feature. Making the lifelog platform open source is our tiny way
of saying thank you to all of those out there who do such great work.

Second, the data collected on the lifelog platform is sensitive in nature. While
we take every step to keep your data secure, we realize that some people want to
store their data on their own servers. If you have the technical chops to do so,
we want you to use our software. If you do set up lifelog on your own server,
please consider giving us feedback so that we can continue to improve our
service.
