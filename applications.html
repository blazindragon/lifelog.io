The lifelog website isn't the only way you can micro-journal with lifelog.
Lifelog follows a [documented api][1] which can be implemented by any client.
There have already been a few clients written for various platforms. If a
particular platform that you are looking for isn't listed, send in a feature
request and we'll try our best to get it built for you. If you build one
yourself, let us know and we'll feature it here!
